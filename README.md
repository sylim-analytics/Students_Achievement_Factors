# Students_Achievement_Factors
Analyzed academic performance data from 6,604 students to identify key factors affecting student success. Utilized Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for comprehensive data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to uncover actionable insights for improving educational outcomes.

## Job Relevance
This project aligns with responsibilities such as:
- Cleaning and analyzing large-scale program data
- Generating visual summaries and reports for data validation and exploratory purposes
- Identifying trends related to  student engagement, access, and performance
- Communicating findings clearly to support education stakeholders and decision-makers

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Imputed missing values in variables such as Teacher_Quality, Distance_from_Home, and Parental_Education_Level using median or most frequent values- Standardized column names to snake_case
- Standardized column names to snake_case for consistency
- Assessed distributions and tested normality using Anderson-Darling test
- Applied Box-Cox transformation to normalize skewed numerical features and address outliers
- Encoded binary variables using 0/1 mapping
- Applied ordinal encoding for ranked categorical variables
- Standardized numerical features post-transformation to support fair comparisons and modeling

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Conducted statistical summaries and assessed data completeness
- Used histograms, KDE plots, and boxplots to understand distributions and detect anomalies
- Investigated relationships between key variables to guide further analysis and data validation

##  Key Findings:
- 'Attendance' and 'Hours Studied' were the strongest predictors of exam success.
- 'Previous Scores' predict future success, emphasizing the value of early academic support and intervention.
- 'Internet Access' positively influences performance by enabling digital learning, but responsible usage is essential to avoid negative effects.

## Visualization and Reporting
Prepared clear visual summaries and written reports to validate data quality and communicate key insights to education stakeholders, supporting data-driven decision-making and program improvement initiatives.
